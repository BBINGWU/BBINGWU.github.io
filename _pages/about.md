<!-- Interest

<!-- Education Background

A senior student majoring in cyberspace technology interested in Cryptography.

I've leaned several related courses including Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Mathematical Foundations of Public Key Cryptography, Cryptanalysis and so on. However I found these reviews about lattice and ZKP are quite confusing, especially when it comes to definitions and security proof. I guess it's due to I lack some knowledge in complexity theory. 

I can't stand just skimming through these classic papers and reviews without deep thinking. So currently I'm learning complexity theory ðŸ’ª and after that I will start to read reviews in lattice and ZKP. 

(Please don't skip me just because right now I lack some preliminary knowledge ðŸ˜€.)

I'm passionate about cryptography and enjoy discussing in this field. We can dicuss together if you want a partner to talk about it and have the same interset as me ðŸ¥³!
